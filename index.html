                    I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Management and Systems at UC Berkeley. I am passionate about finding and understanding patterns in information systems and the natural world. By analyzing these interactions, I aim to develop humane strategies and technologies that address current and future challenges, ultimately contributing to a more balanced and egalitarian society.

                    I am a voracious Wondery podcast listener. I have consumed hundreds of podcast series, including American Innovations, Business Wars, and Business Movers.

                    My current favorite movie is The Beekeeper starring Jason Statham. Soul has been my all-time favourite movie because of its inspiration to keep fighting for what you love.

                    The book I am planning to read now is "Ego Is the Enemy" by Ryan Holiday.

                    I’d love to hear what your favorite movie is or what you enjoy doing in your free time.I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Management and Systems at UC Berkeley.
